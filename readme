GLOBALS
I went a bit nuts with globals again, and again, it was to enable me to pass
more work to functions and cut down on the length of my main functions. And 
it's been working well on these large programs that already make me feel out 
of my depth. Keeping track of passing & returning so many values is an extra 
layer I'll avoid to save time and get my grades.
