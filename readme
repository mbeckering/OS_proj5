GLOBALS
I went a bit nuts with globals again, and again, it was to enable me to pass
more work to functions and cut down on the length of my mains. And 
it's been working well on these large programs that already make me feel out 
of my depth.

MESSAGE QUEUE
OSS only looks for messages of type 99, and doesn't wait (IPC_NOWAIT). Users 
only look for messages of type (my_pnum + 100), so pid 0 looks for mtype 100, 
pid 16 looks for mtype 116, etc. This is because I already built all my arrays 
and loops as [0-17] before recalling that telling msgrcv to look for mtype 0 
will cause it to pick up ANY message in the queue.
